I created docker image with Haskell Stack installation. Also Dockerfile 
creates a new Stack project and removes it. This way image already contains 
basic Haskell libraries and tools to build a basic project so redownloading 
those on every run can be avoided.

Image also cointains a directory (/root/projects) that can be used to mount
project directory from host machine. 

Git is also installed.
